Creative CSS animation effects add dynamic visual interest to web pages, making them more engaging and interactive. By utilizing keyframes, transitions, and transforms, developers can create smooth animations such as fading, sliding, scaling, or rotating elements. These effects can enhance user experience, guide attention to important content, and bring web designs to life with minimal effort. Whether it's a subtle hover effect or a complex animated sequence, CSS animations are a powerful tool for modern web design.
